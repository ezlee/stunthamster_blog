Right now, DevOps is the latest buzzword. Everyone is producing tools that market themselves as DevOps tools, people
are feverishly rehashing C.V.s to liberally mention the term, and of course, recruiters are looking for people with ten
years experience in a buzzword that still has that ‘New car smell’ on it.  Best of all, in the background, we as a
community are still trying to come to terms with what this label might actually mean. However, for some companies,
they see DevOps as their latest saviour.

In the tech community, we often read about, and see, the successes, the people who’ve taken the world by storm, using
nothing more than a great idea and a collection of amazing people. What we don’t read about so much, are the also rans,
the companies that make a decent -ish living by coasting along on ideas that never quite took off, but by the same
token, didn’t explode in the hanger.  These companies are generally trading in the B2B space, and look to these
younger, more agile companies with someting approaching a combination of jealousy and awe. How do these companies do
it? They ask in  bewildered tones, ‘They haven’t any ISO certificates! They lack  a dress code! And by god, they seem
to attend conferences all the goddamn time!’

At this point, they generally cast their eyes around, wondering how they can take on some of the magic that these
companies seem to posses, and go out and hire DevOps consultants (Just like me!), Agile consultants, and then….
Completely ignore the more basic issues they face, and it’s a message I try to pass to all my clients.

If you are in a nich industry, and you are not embracing agilty, both in terms of platform, but also development, and
even company, then someone is going to come along and destroy you. If you take months to make simple changes, than
another company will destroy you.

If you want DevOps techniques, you need to embrace agility.
