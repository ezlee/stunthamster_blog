Greetings

You’ve managed to find the corner of the internet that Michael Duffy lives. Hello! That’s me.

As you may have gathered by a brief look at the blog posts, I’m a freelance Devops Engineer and writer. If you looked
at the front page and it’s empty, then I’ve either forgotten to upload the content, or I’m in the middle of yet another
redesign. It’s probably the latter.

Let’s get to the heart of the matter, if your reading the about page, you probably want to know a little bit more about
me, and what it is I do. Let’s take a look!

DevOps consultancy

I’ve been practicing a methodology akin to ‘DevOps’ before it became a buzzword that all the cool kids want to use.
Essentially, this means that I’ve been an embedded systems administrator in many different development teams, and
worked with those fine fellows to both improve the delivered product, and to smooth the deployment process. My roles
generally take in everything from full stack automation, through to infrastructure design and architecture. I’ve worked
for companies such as Telefonica O2 and BskyB, through to small startups, and can quite happily work with, and manage
projects that are budgeted from anywhere from fifty million pounds through to fifty pence. Some of the projects I’ve
worked on have been the design, implementation and automation of the infrastructure powering the online search features
of the Sky set top box (Over three million connected clients), the automation of the o2.co.uk web pages
(Including several iPhone launches, AKA a DDOS in a box), and the implementation of DevOps practices at several startups.

I enjoy working within Agile development teams, but equally, have worked with people who pray to the altar of
prince 2 methodology; As long as your project is interesting, your team fun, and the coffee fair to middling, then
I’m interested in working with you. I’m comfortable leading teams, and can introduce an existing team to DevOps
practices, both from a technological point of view, but also from the point of view of integrating with agile practices.

I’m currently buzzword compatible with the existing technologies:

- Ansible
- Puppet
- Docker
- Redhat & Ubuntu Linux
- Ruby
- Bash
- AWS
- And of course the usual basic requirements for systems administrators such as TCP networking, firewalls, etc.

If you’re interested in hiring me then drop me a line.

Writing

As you may have gathered from the occasional shameless plug on this site, I’m also a writer. My first book, Puppet
Reporting and Monitoring is available from Packt Publishing. This fine tome takes you from the basics for Puppet
reporting, and explores the ways you can leverage Puppets powerful, yet almost unspoken of, reporting mechanism to
clue you into what’s going on with your infrastructure. I have two more books in development, one covering more of
the DevOps toolchain, and the other a guide for writers to implement a more realistic, and yet hardcore, view of
technology in fiction.

I’m available for freelance writing, and if you want me to cover topics ranging from DevOps techniques, general
technology, or industry trends for your blog, magazine or internal corporate newsletter, then feel free to contact me.

Personal

I’m a slightly rotund chap with occasional mad hair, and a suspect beard. I live in Suffolk with my wife, daughter,
 and soon to be new baby. I ride motorbikes, fish, and spend an inordinate amount of time fixing the bits of my house that
  keep falling apart.
